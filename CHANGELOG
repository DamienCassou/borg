* v1.0.0    2016/12/31

- Repository moved to https://github.com/emacscollective/borg.

- The ~~/.emacs.d/bin/borg-bootstrap~ script can now add additional
  remotes.  That script is part of the repository of the ~emacs.g~
  collective.  It cannot be part of the ~borg~ repository, because it
  is has to be available before the ~borg~ repository and all the other
  drone/submodule repositories are cloned.  But the documentation
  about this script can be found in the ~borg~ manual.

- ~borg-initialize~ now uses a cache to avoid calling ~git config~
  excessively.  On Windows this significantly improves performance.

- ~borg-drones~ learned to optionally return drone variables instead
  of just the drone names.

- ~borg-byte-compile~ and ~borg-update-autoloads~ now don't require the
  PATH argument.

- ~borg-uninstall~ was broken.

- The manual was updated heavily.

- Cosmetic and other minor improvements.

- Minor bug fixes and typo fixes.

* v0.1.3    2016/09/01

- Added new function ~borg-batch-rebuild-init~ to allow compiling
  just the init files without also compiling all drones.

* v0.1.2    2016/08/27

- ~borg-batch-rebuild~ now also compiles the secondary init file
  ~<user-real-login-name>.el~ if present.

- ~borg-batch-rebuild~ now compiles ~org~ before all other packages.

* v0.1.1    2016/05/18
